dev.plone.org has moved!
========================

Plone and its community are continually updating and upgrading our infrastructure and tooling. We have moved our version control and issue tracking to Github.

To file an issue, please visit our `Issue Tracker on GiHub <https://github.com/plone/cmf.plone/issues>`_.

To contribute to the Plone Core, please read about our `Process for Plone core's development <http://docs.plone.org/develop/coredev/docs/index.html>`_ first.

Our old Subversion repository is in 'read only mode' at https://svn.plone.org; you can also download it from https://archive.plone.org/svn (approximately 16 GB in size).

To download the old static version of dev.plone.org go to https://archive.plone.org/olddev which includes the old Trac wiki and issue tracker **and** our Subversion repository.
