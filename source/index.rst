dev.plone.org has moved!
========================

Hello, Friend! Fear not — all that was dev.plone.org is not lost or gone forever. Plone's version control, issue tracking, and documentation have been retooled, given lots of love, and moved to a new home so it's easier to find and use. 

Plone code now lives at GitHub. To file or view an issue please visit the `Plone Issue Tracker on GitHub <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues>`_.

Plone documentation — how to install, manage, use, and develop for Plone — is available at `docs.plone.org <http://docs.plone.org>`_. However, if you want to contribute to Plone Core you'll need to read our `Process for Plone Core Development <http://docs.plone.org/develop/coredev/docs/index.html>`_ first.

A read-only version of the old Subversion repository is available at `svn.plone.org <https://svn.plone.org>`_. To download it (it's ~16 GB) visit `archive.plone.org/svn <https://archive.plone.org/svn>`_.

The old static version of dev.plone.org, including the old Trac wiki, issue tracker, **and** the Subversion repository, can be downloaded from `archive.plone.org/olddev <https://archive.plone.org/olddev>`_.
